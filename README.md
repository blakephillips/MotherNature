# Mother Nature

A remake of a game I made on the [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) virtual console for a gamejam that should be playable here:
- https://blakers.itch.io/mother-nature
- or here: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=106404

The original pico-8 game is lacking in quite a few features, and quality of life features. There is only one enemy, the velocity of the attacks are annoyingly random / inaccurate, no gamefeel, etc. These things are hoping to be fixed in this re-make of the game.

This project is built on the [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) game framework.
